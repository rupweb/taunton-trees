<p>As hollies go, some are typically prickly, others have not a single prickly spine. There are hollies of all shades of green and many variegations into attractive and subtle supporting colours, but as it is with this variety, those with the most long-lasting, profusely borne or brilliantly red winter berries are inevitably the most sought after. This variety is of almost spineless green leaves and large, regular crops of red fruits. Hollies will usually adapt to most soil conditions. Pruning is rarely necessary and this variety is self-pollinating. 
<p><font color="#ffdd00"><strong>Suggested Uses</strong></font>
<p>Ornamental shrubs and berry producing trees. 
<p><font color="#ffdd00"><strong>Size</strong></font>
<p>From 5 feet high
